First, I helped spearhead integration of the JavaScript library Dojo Toolkit into Zend Framework, and finalized the work that month. I&amp;rsquo;d worked closely with the two developers who had been leading that project at the time, and one thing that came up during our discussions was that they had helped create an open source foundation for the project, to ensure its continuity and longevity, and to ensure the project can outlive the ups and downs of any commercial company.</description></item><item><title>How to Pass Variables to a Partial Template in Hugo</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-14-harmstyler-how-to-pass-variables-to-a-partial-template-in-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2019 02:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-14-harmstyler-how-to-pass-variables-to-a-partial-template-in-hugo/</guid><description>As a developer, I want to keep my code as DRY as is feasible for the given project. In a Hugo project, that&amp;rsquo;s where the Partial templates come in. Partials are smaller, context-aware components in your list and page templates that can be used economically to keep your templating DRY. Partials, however, have one serious limitation, they&amp;rsquo;re cached during the build of a given page (or scope). Once a partial has been created, no outside logic can adjust what the partial returns (for the page).</description></item><item><title>Community blogs</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hosting Hugo on Aws Cloudfront and Route53 Using Ansible</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to to set up a website on AWS&amp;rsquo;s s3 service, but if you want to use a certificate (you do), it&amp;rsquo;s just a bit more work.

This was strange because in Wireshark the requests looked basically the same.
It turned out that the embedded system hosting the web interface was rejecting Ethernet frames larger than 1500 bytes. This was most likely because of a misinterpretation of the MTU as referring to the frame size (at layer 2) instead of the payload size (at layer 3).</description></item><item><title>So You Want to Change the Gravity Forms Form Tag…</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2016-04-01-josh-broton-so-you-want-to-change-the-gravity-forms-form-tag/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 02:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2016-04-01-josh-broton-so-you-want-to-change-the-gravity-forms-form-tag/</guid><description>I had an interesting request from a client today.

He found a PowerShell script to update a subdomain with the current IP address of the system running the script. The subdomain detail was the crux of the question: how to get it to update a &amp;ldquo;naked&amp;rdquo; domain. Several of us read through the API reference but the dnsUpdateRecord function didn&amp;rsquo;t explain how to update the base domain&amp;rsquo;s A record.</description></item><item><title>Linux Performance</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2016-02-08-sclarson-linux-performance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2016 17:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2016-02-08-sclarson-linux-performance/</guid><description>I&amp;#8217;ve been asked a few times for how to find performance issues around various types on linux.

This probably isn&amp;rsquo;t something most people care about, or maybe even solve by using multiple wallets, but I thought that it would be nice to choose which addresses were used for transactions. I found that I was not alone in that desire. But sadly, the patch has yet to be merged despite going through a number of iterations.</description></item></channel></rss>
