At the time Facebook didn’t redirect HTTP -&amp;gt; HTTPS by default and most users were connecting over plaintext.
Since then Facebook has switched to secure browsing by default, and most companies are encrypting traffic in transit whether it’s internal or external.</description></item><item><title>Hosting a User Group on Zoom (when it’s normally in person)</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2020-04-11-brian-olson-hosting-a-user-group-on-zoom-when-its-normally-in-person/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 15:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2020-04-11-brian-olson-hosting-a-user-group-on-zoom-when-its-normally-in-person/</guid><description>I’m not looking to add to the noise around using zoom to work remotely and connect with people during social distancing, but after spending some time on Google I couldn’t find a guide on how to do this.

Knowing how to use the Compiler API can, however, may seem like a daunting task. In this session, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate a number of real-world examples that use the Compiler API to provide useful functionality and features via analyzers, refactorings, and .NET Core tools. You&amp;rsquo;ll see how straightforward this API is, and you&amp;rsquo;ll understand how to apply it in your own applications.</description></item><item><title>Tips and tricks for getting started in CDK (a.k.a.

IaC is great, but these tools have some short comings like yaml being very verbose, and the powershell AWS SDKs not handling idem potency for you.
Because of those short comings, I was very excited when AWS released AWS CDK a little over a year ago now. It cuts down on a lot of copying and pasting yaml files like you do in cloudformation, and gives you easier access to higher level language constructs like loops and if statements.</description></item><item><title>Overcoming EF Run-time Exceptions when Deploying .Net Core 3.1+ to Service Fabric</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2020-02-29-aligned-dev-overcoming-ef-run-time-exceptions-when-deploying-net-core-3-1-to-service-fabric/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2020-02-29-aligned-dev-overcoming-ef-run-time-exceptions-when-deploying-net-core-3-1-to-service-fabric/</guid><description>Overcoming Entity Framework Run-time Exceptions when Deploying .Net Core 3.1+ to Service Fabric I recently had a several day fight with a run-time exception.

The idea of edge functions is by no means new. Amazon does it with Lambda, CloudFlare has Workers, Google Cloud and Azure both call theirs Functions.
To the best of my knowledge, Fastly&amp;rsquo;s offering is unique in its use of wasm, and this has enabled them to have really fast boot and response times.</description></item><item><title>Hack Sioux Falls Final Projects (Spring 2019)</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-07-28-william-bushee-hack-sioux-falls-final-projects-spring-2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 13:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-07-28-william-bushee-hack-sioux-falls-final-projects-spring-2019/</guid><description>Eighteen kids, eight meet-ups, zero shorted boards, seven blown LEDs, one burnt finger, and two months of fun &amp;amp; creativity.

In a Hugo project, that’s where the Partial templates come in. Partials are smaller, context-aware components in your list and page templates that can be used economically to keep your templating DRY. Partials, however, have one serious limitation, they’re cached during the build of a given page (or scope). Once a partial has been created, no outside logic can adjust what the partial returns (for the page).</description></item><item><title>Community blogs</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hosting Hugo on Aws Cloudfront and Route53 Using Ansible</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</guid><description>It’s really easy to to set up a website on AWS’s s3 service, but if you want to use a certificate (you do), it’s just a bit more work.

If you don’t, take a look through Entity Framework documentation and its migrations section before continuing.
Introduction If you’ve ever worked with the Entity Framework ORM for any length of time, then you’ve likely worked with its migrations feature. And more than likely, you’ve had to debug one (or many) of your migrations when trying to run an update-database through the package manager console.</description></item><item><title>Showing Firefox close tab on tab hover</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-01-03-austin-hanson-showing-firefox-close-tab-on-tab-hover/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2019 14:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-01-03-austin-hanson-showing-firefox-close-tab-on-tab-hover/</guid><description>I switched from Chrome to Firefox a few months ago. For the most part…it feels roughly the same but there was one subtle difference that finally irked me to the point of googling: having to right click on a tab to close it. In Chrome, when you hover over the active tab the close button pops up. This means you can pretty easily close multiple tabs by clicking the last tab on the right, clicking close, and then repeatedly clicking as the close tab appears in each successive tab.</description></item><item><title>IBM i Dotfiles CLI RPM &amp; SoBored RPM Repo</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2018-12-28-sobored-ibm-i-dotfiles-cli-rpm-sobored-rpm-repo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 21:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2018-12-28-sobored-ibm-i-dotfiles-cli-rpm-sobored-rpm-repo/</guid><description>Due to community feedback about the install process and usage of my IBM i Dotfiles, I have decided to create a command line interface (CLI) and an RPM to install the aforementioned CLI.

So what need is there for another (apparent) string wrapper?
Template Literals Template Literals solve a couple thorny issues with traditional strings. Whether you wrap a string in single or double quotes, it’s still a static line of text.</description></item><item><title>.NET Conf Live Day 1</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/net-conf-live-day-1-254182005/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 13:49:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/net-conf-live-day-1-254182005/</guid><description>https://www.dotnetconf.net/agenda

I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with how it turned out. But there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t like about it.
When dealing with iterables in Rust, they can all be chained nicely together. For example,
some_iter .map(...) .filter(...) .enumerate() .collect() The CircularEnumerate&amp;amp;lt;I&amp;amp;gt; class I was playing with is in every way a peer to Rust&amp;rsquo;s classes, except that it can&amp;rsquo;t be chained.</description></item><item><title>C# .NET Core, Console App, DI, and Serilog - Getting Started</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2017-12-21-austin-hanson-c-net-core-console-app-di-and-serilog-getting-started/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 15:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2017-12-21-austin-hanson-c-net-core-console-app-di-and-serilog-getting-started/</guid><description>My day job involves a lot of .NET Core development and a whole lot of logging.

That’s the way it’s always been, and works for you. Stop it. Devices are getting smaller, processors are getting slower, and web apps are more complicated. jQuery can cause some fairly serious performance issues. So let’s take a step back from jQuery and talk about ways VanillaJS is faster and simpler.</description></item><item><title>Reactive Extensions with Jason Bock</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/reactive-extensions-with-jason-bock-169154452/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 01:19:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/reactive-extensions-with-jason-bock-169154452/</guid><description>It’s typical in software development to pull data from different sources. However, in the modern world of asynchronicity, data is being retrieved in real-time streams, akin to how developers handle events. Reactive Extensions is a library that makes it easier to code in a reactive, asynchronous, composable style. In this session, you’ll get a gentle introduction into this library and how its API works.
