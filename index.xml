In a Hugo project, that’s where the Partial templates come in. Partials are smaller, context-aware components in your list and page templates that can be used economically to keep your templating DRY. Partials, however, have one serious limitation, they’re cached during the build of a given page (or scope). Once a partial has been created, no outside logic can adjust what the partial returns (for the page).</description></item><item><title>Community blogs</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hosting Hugo on Aws Cloudfront and Route53 Using Ansible</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</guid><description>It’s really easy to to set up a website on AWS’s s3 service, but if you want to use a certificate (you do), it’s just a bit more work.

This endpoint provides read-only metadata about resources once you have access, and doesn’t require additional authentication.

This was strange because in Wireshark the requests looked basically the same.
It turned out that the embedded system hosting the web interface was rejecting Ethernet frames larger than 1500 bytes. This was most likely because of a misinterpretation of the MTU as referring to the frame size (at layer 2) instead of the payload size (at layer 3).</description></item><item><title>So You Want to Change the Gravity Forms Form Tag…</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2016-04-01-josh-broton-so-you-want-to-change-the-gravity-forms-form-tag/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 02:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2016-04-01-josh-broton-so-you-want-to-change-the-gravity-forms-form-tag/</guid><description>I had an interesting request from a client today.

He found a PowerShell script to update a subdomain with the current IP address of the system running the script. The subdomain detail was the crux of the question: how to get it to update a &amp;ldquo;naked&amp;rdquo; domain.

This probably isn't something most people care about, or maybe even solve by using multiple wallets, but I thought that it would be nice to choose which addresses were used for transactions. I found that I was not alonein that desire. But sadly, the patch has yet to be merged despite going through a number of iterations.</description></item></channel></rss>
