You do it all the time, so you know to type
But out of force of habit you type
And hit the tab key. Now you’re sitting and waiting for several minutes while Powershell loads all of the AWS modules for IAM, ECS, Cloudfront, S3, etc, etc, etc, even though you only want to interact with EC2.</description></item><item><title>Hosting is a Detail</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2020-01-30-aligned-dev-hosting-is-a-detail/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2020-01-30-aligned-dev-hosting-is-a-detail/</guid><description>Hosting is a detail Last summer, we read Clean Architecture by Bob Martin as a book club at Omnitech. We all learned a lot. I even co-presented at SD Code Camp about Clean Architecture with John Townsend. Uncle Bob showed us in his book that we need to isolate our Critical Business Rule Code from our Application Rule Code. Then we need to create another layer to isolate from the details such as the database, devices, web, UI and external interfaces.</description></item><item><title>AWS Lambda Functions with Modular Powershell</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2020-01-18-brian-olson-aws-lambda-functions-with-modular-powershell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2020 23:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2020-01-18-brian-olson-aws-lambda-functions-with-modular-powershell/</guid><description>It’s been a while since AWS released support for running Powershell in Lambda Functions. Up until now all of the Lambda functions I’ve worked with have been either python or NodeJS, but we recently had a project that needed to update a database from inside of a deployment pipeline.

Fastly&amp;rsquo;s vision is to use wasm to sandbox and run applications, which means that any language that can compile to wasm can run on their edge servers.
The idea of edge functions is by no means new. Amazon does it with Lambda, CloudFlare has Workers, Google Cloud and Azure both call theirs Functions.
To the best of my knowledge, Fastly&amp;rsquo;s offering is unique in its use of wasm, and this has enabled them to have really fast boot and response times.</description></item><item><title>Hack Sioux Falls Final Projects (Spring 2019)</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-07-28-william-bushee-hack-sioux-falls-final-projects-spring-2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 13:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-07-28-william-bushee-hack-sioux-falls-final-projects-spring-2019/</guid><description>Eighteen kids, eight meet-ups, zero shorted boards, seven blown LEDs, one burnt finger, and two months of fun &amp;amp; creativity.

In a Hugo project, that’s where the Partial templates come in. Partials are smaller, context-aware components in your list and page templates that can be used economically to keep your templating DRY. Partials, however, have one serious limitation, they’re cached during the build of a given page (or scope). Once a partial has been created, no outside logic can adjust what the partial returns (for the page).</description></item><item><title>Community blogs</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hosting Hugo on Aws Cloudfront and Route53 Using Ansible</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</guid><description>It’s really easy to to set up a website on AWS’s s3 service, but if you want to use a certificate (you do), it’s just a bit more work.

Strings are already pretty lucky. Developers can use single quotes or double quotes to wrap around a string. (Some languages only get half that many options!) So what need is there for another (apparent) string wrapper?
Template Literals Template Literals solve a couple thorny issues with traditional strings. Whether you wrap a string in single or double quotes, it’s still a static line of text.</description></item><item><title>.NET Conf Live Day 1</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/net-conf-live-day-1-254182005/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 13:49:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/net-conf-live-day-1-254182005/</guid><description>https://www.dotnetconf.net/agenda

If you’re like me and need to access many IBM i instances, copying your dotfile configurations and keeping them synced between instances can become cumbersome. Maybe you don’t need to access multiple IBM i instances, but you have complex configurations and scripts, and would like to keep them version controlled simply for organization and backup.</description></item><item><title>Mesos, Marathon, and Docker</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/mesos-marathon-and-docker-248071996/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 15:46:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/mesos-marathon-and-docker-248071996/</guid><description>What is Apache Mesos? What is Mesosphere’s Marathon? How do they work and work together? As a developer, how can I wire these up in order to execute applications in a compute environment?
Mesos is a cluster manager that abstracts computing resources away from machines enabling both fault tolerance and distributed elastic systems. Marathon enables orchestration for Docker containers, including persistence and high availability. The combination of these three software packages enables a proven framework for container orchestration and high compute resource utilization over large node clusters.</description></item><item><title>Learn About Blockchains</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/learn-about-blockchains-246909966/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 14:04:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/learn-about-blockchains-246909966/</guid><description>What is blockchain technology?How does it work and what applications exist?As a developer, how do I get started implementing my own blockchain?

I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with how it turned out. But there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t like about it.
When dealing with iterables in Rust, they can all be chained nicely together. For example,
some_iter .map(...) .filter(...) .enumerate() .collect() The CircularEnumerate&amp;amp;lt;I&amp;amp;gt; class I was playing with is in every way a peer to Rust&amp;rsquo;s classes, except that it can&amp;rsquo;t be chained.</description></item><item><title>C# .NET Core, Console App, DI, and Serilog - Getting Started</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2017-12-21-austin-hanson-c-net-core-console-app-di-and-serilog-getting-started/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 15:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2017-12-21-austin-hanson-c-net-core-console-app-di-and-serilog-getting-started/</guid><description>My day job involves a lot of .NET Core development and a whole lot of logging.

This was strange because in Wireshark the requests looked basically the same.
It turned out that the embedded system hosting the web interface was rejecting Ethernet frames larger than 1500 bytes.

That’s the way it’s always been, and works for you. Stop it. Devices are getting smaller, processors are getting slower, and web apps are more complicated. jQuery can cause some fairly serious performance issues. So let’s take a step back from jQuery and talk about ways VanillaJS is faster and simpler.</description></item><item><title>Reactive Extensions with Jason Bock</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/reactive-extensions-with-jason-bock-169154452/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 01:19:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/reactive-extensions-with-jason-bock-169154452/</guid><description>It’s typical in software development to pull data from different sources. However, in the modern world of asynchronicity, data is being retrieved in real-time streams, akin to how developers handle events. Reactive Extensions is a library that makes it easier to code in a reactive, asynchronous, composable style. In this session, you’ll get a gentle introduction into this library and how its API works.
