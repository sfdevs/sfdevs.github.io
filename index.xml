      <description>Long story short, this is what we look for in our .NET developers: In addition to the server-side language, we need someone who loves to code and knows HTML, Javascript, CSS, and jQuery. We need someone who can take ideas and turn them into clean, solid code. Someone who can grasp the big picture while still getting the details right. Someone who can turn out great websites without losing their sense of humor. Youâ€™re out there. We know it.</description>

      <description>Join Omnitech Software Engineer Kevin Logan for part TWO of a lunch-hour dive into Unit Testing.
The combined talks will include a short introduction to unit testing in general, along with some hands-on-keyboard work following Kevin with C# MVC API unit tests. The lessons will be broadly applicable to unit testing in general, including other programming languages.
The second meeting will give us time to talk about experiences and look into integration testing in .</description>

      <description>Last week, I did some system updates, and then decided to compile the most recent PHP releases. I&amp;rsquo;ve used phpbrew to manage multiple PHP releases for a number of years, and having it install a new version is fairly routine.
Except this time, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Due to updates I installed, I was getting errors first with compiling the GD extension, then with ext-intl:
 If you want Freetype support in ext-gd, you are expected to install the package libfreetype-dev.</description>

      <description>Ten years ago this month, I was involved in a couple of huge changes for Zend Framework.
First, I helped spearhead integration of the JavaScript library Dojo Toolkit into Zend Framework, and finalized the work that month. I&amp;rsquo;d worked closely with the two developers who had been leading that project at the time, and one thing that came up during our discussions was that they had helped create an open source foundation for the project, to ensure its continuity and longevity, and to ensure the project can outlive the ups and downs of any commercial company.</description>

      <title>How to Pass Variables to a Partial Template in Hugo</title>

      <description>As a developer, I want to keep my code as DRY as is feasible for the given project. In a Hugo project, that&amp;rsquo;s where the Partial templates come in. Partials are smaller, context-aware components in your list and page templates that can be used economically to keep your templating DRY. Partials, however, have one serious limitation, they&amp;rsquo;re cached during the build of a given page (or scope). Once a partial has been created, no outside logic can adjust what the partial returns (for the page).</description>

      <title>Hosting Hugo on Aws Cloudfront and Route53 Using Ansible</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to to set up a website on AWS&amp;rsquo;s s3 service, but if you want to use a certificate (you do), it&amp;rsquo;s just a bit more work. With Ansible as my hammer, everything is a nail. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick playbook I used to set up my site jxn.is to use cloudfront. This playbook creates the bucket, sets up an s3 website in the bucket, creates a cloudfront distribution with reasonable parameters, enables an existing Certificate Manager certificate on the site, and points DNS records at the cloudfront distribution.</description>

      <description>I am a long-time gnome-shell user. I appreciate the simplicity and elegance it provides, as I prefer having a minimalist environment that still provides me easy access to the applications I use.
That said, just as with any desktop environment, I&amp;rsquo;ve still run into problems now and again. One that&amp;rsquo;s been plaguing me since at least the 18.04 release is with display of app indicators, specifically those using legacy system tray APIs.</description>

      <description>I like Git over TFVC I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a new contract and we are using TFVC here. It&amp;rsquo;s a decent tool (used to be THE tool and was much better then SourceSafe before that) for version control (you&amp;rsquo;re doing version control, right??!!), but I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself saying &amp;ldquo;Git is so much better&amp;rdquo; out loud. I do really miss Git, but I need to be careful in presenting change (I don&amp;rsquo;t want to cause angst or feelings that things can&amp;rsquo;t be changed in the developers current company.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of AWS&amp;rsquo;s SDK&amp;rsquo;s and API tools because they&amp;rsquo;re so comprehensive and easy to use, in general, but I sometimes forget that there&amp;rsquo;s another good, even simpler API for getting data from some AWS resources&amp;hellip; the magical http://169.254.169.254/ http endpoint! This endpoint provides read-only metadata about resources once you have access, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require additional authentication. This is very handy, for instance, when a client gives me SSH or RDP access to an EC2 instance and I need to know its size, network info, or in this case what Availability Zone it is in:</description>

      <description>Making sure webistes are accessible is a big deal these days. Websites should be mindful of their audience to make sure people with disabilities are not excluded from the site content. Color contrasts between foregrounds and backgrounds is an easy miss when checking that a site is accessible, but one that is vital to hard of sight users.</description>

      <description>I know I should be Unit Testing, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how or where to start - Basic Workshop Version I started writing about and giving presentations last year. This year, our company has decided to use that material and give a &amp;ldquo;Getting started with Unit Testing workshop&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve given this 3 times now at Omnitech. Once to a pilot group, then to our normal Tuesday Lunch and Learn group, then to those who didn&amp;rsquo;t make it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty heavily reorganizing and simplifying my life lately, so it was time to replace the tired old Wordpress blog at ShellRunner with something more deserving. Wordpress has been a great platform over the years, but as a constant target of attacks, it could also be a pain to keep up. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s much more fun to write my posts in Markdown, instead of in a browser editor. This is post #1 trying out Hugo, a fast static generator written in Go with a lot of features.</description>

      <description>eZ Platform boils down to a set of Symfony bundles that give you a nice way of managing content for your users. With these bundles, eZ reserves some routing paths for internal or admin use, paths that you might want for your own app. If you ever run across a path you want to use for your app, and not break an internal eZ feature, there is a simple solution: change the path config.</description>

      <description>This week at work I was faced with a bug that manifested as Windows XP clients being slower to access parts of a web interface than Windows 7 or 10. This was strange because in Wireshark the requests looked basically the same.
It turned out that the embedded system hosting the web interface was rejecting Ethernet frames larger than 1500 bytes. This was most likely because of a misinterpretation of the MTU as referring to the frame size (at layer 2) instead of the payload size (at layer 3).</description>

      <description>A friend asked several people on irc about NameSilo&amp;rsquo;s API and dynamic DNS entries. He found a PowerShell script to update a subdomain with the current IP address of the system running the script. The subdomain detail was the crux of the question: how to get it to update a &amp;ldquo;naked&amp;rdquo; domain. Several of us read through the API reference but the dnsUpdateRecord function didn&amp;rsquo;t explain how to update the base domain&amp;rsquo;s A record.</description>

      <description>In playing with Bitcoin, in this case specifically with the bitcoin-qt client, I found myself wanting to more granularly control which of my coins I spent. This probably isn&amp;rsquo;t something most people care about, or maybe even solve by using multiple wallets, but I thought that it would be nice to choose which addresses were used for transactions. I found that I was not alone in that desire. But sadly, the patch has yet to be merged despite going through a number of iterations.</description>
