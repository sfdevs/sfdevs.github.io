Knowing how to use the Compiler API can, however, may seem like a daunting task. In this session, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate a number of real-world examples that use the Compiler API to provide useful functionality and features via analyzers, refactorings, and .NET Core tools. You&amp;rsquo;ll see how straightforward this API is, and you&amp;rsquo;ll understand how to apply it in your own applications.</description></item><item><title>Fundamentals of networking for web developers</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/fundamentals-of-networking-for-web-developers-268122064/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2020 15:02:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/fundamentals-of-networking-for-web-developers-268122064/</guid><description>We have all used the internet.

Over the course of the talk we&amp;rsquo;ll be diving into the world of GraphQL covering advantages and difficulties of developing a GraphQL API. From a starting point of defining new vocabulary in use with GraphQL we&amp;rsquo;ll advance to more difficult topics such as pagination, authentication and schema stitching.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Unit Testing Workshop (2 of 2)</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/getting-started-with-unit-testing-workshop-2-of-2-261680554/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 13:51:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/getting-started-with-unit-testing-workshop-2-of-2-261680554/</guid><description>Join Omnitech Software Engineer Kevin Logan for part TWO of a lunch-hour dive into Unit Testing.

Thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s always been, and works for you.Â Stop it.Â Devices are getting smaller, processors are getting slower, and web apps are more complicated. jQuery can cause some fairly serious performance issues.Â So letâ€™s take a step back from jQuery and talk about ways VanillaJS is faster and simpler.</description></item><item><title>Reactive Extensions with Jason Bock</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/reactive-extensions-with-jason-bock-169154452/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 01:19:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/reactive-extensions-with-jason-bock-169154452/</guid><description>Itâ€™s typical in software development to pull data from different sources. However, in the modern world of asynchronicity, data is being retrieved in real-time streams, akin to how developers handle events. Reactive Extensions is a library that makes it easier to code in a reactive, asynchronous, composable style. In this session, youâ€™ll get a gentle introduction into this library and how its API works.

This covers an introduction to nodejs from console.log through making asynchronous http requests.
Josh Broton, Seth Larson, and other members will be available to help people through any problems they run across. Attendees do have to supply their own computer(or pair with someone else who did).
If you attended our test run of this in January and completed Learn Node feel free to move on to Stream Adventure, Async, or one of the other modules.</description></item><item><title>SICP Discussion</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/sicp-discussion-dgfnwhysfbxb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2014 08:47:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/sicp-discussion-dgfnwhysfbxb/</guid><description>For March 18th, we&amp;rsquo;ll be covering the first two sections of Chapter 2.

Following discussion on how we(and you) go about making deploying updates an easy and seamless operation, at least as seamless as organization processes allow.
If anyone has used Puppet I&amp;rsquo;d love for input from them in how it compares/contrasts to Chef.
Any other deployment tools would also be open for discussion. Capistrano, Fabric, PSake are a few I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with that come to mind.</description></item><item><title>Responsive Web Design</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/responsive-web-design-120546172/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2013 16:40:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/responsive-web-design-120546172/</guid><description>Josh Broton is going to lead a discussion on Responsive Web Design.</description></item><item><title>Compare and Contrast DVCS Tools (primarily git and mercurial)</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/compare-and-contrast-dvcs-tools-primarily-git-and-mercurial-118399832/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2013 13:12:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/compare-and-contrast-dvcs-tools-primarily-git-and-mercurial-118399832/</guid><description>Plan is to do a very short short (10 minutes?) centralized vs. distributed overview and then probably do an outline of some of the main different DVCS approaches. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll do a deep dive into the subtle differences between git &amp;amp; mercurial. (How branching is subtly different between the two, why reflog is amazing, how subrepos are handled differently, rebase vs. merge, etc.) I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the different commandline and graphical user interface options for each as well at some point.</description></item><item><title>Open discussion on essential tools</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/open-discussion-on-essential-tools-111551542/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2013 16:11:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/open-discussion-on-essential-tools-111551542/</guid><description>Whatever you use for Development, Deployment, Testing, etc. Open discussion about problems you&amp;rsquo;ve ran into and how you and others have fixed or hacked around them.

I&amp;rsquo;ll have some examples/notes but with how many people signed up to attend I know to have significant JS experience it would be foolish not to have this more discussion based.</description></item><item><title>Mike Benkovich presenting: Cross-Platform, Cross-Device, Connected-Apps Oh My!</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/events/mike-benkovich-presenting-cross-platform-cross-device-connected-apps-oh-my-86032232/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2012 10:08:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/events/mike-benkovich-presenting-cross-platform-cross-device-connected-apps-oh-my-86032232/</guid><description>Mike Benkovich is a Developer Evangelist at Microsoft and will be in town to talk about cross platform cross device connectivity in applications.
