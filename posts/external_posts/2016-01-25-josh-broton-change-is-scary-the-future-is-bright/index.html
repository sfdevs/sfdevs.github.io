That’s a hard thing for me to write. I’ve been at Lemonly since December 2013, two of the best years of my life. But as with all things in life, change is what keeps us scared and growing.</p><p>What’s next? I’m finally starting my own business. I’ve been doing contract front-end development, building anything from huge web apps to WordPress themes, for startups and agencies, part time, for almost 5 years. It’s been a very successful endeavor, and so it’s time to do it with 100% of my energy and focus. It means I’ll be giving up 8 hrs a day with some of my best friends in the world, but to stay scared, and to continue to grow, it’s a step I have to take.</p><p>I’m excited (and scared) for the change. I’m excited to work less, after 2 years of 60-hour weeks. I’m excited to get back to my neglected side projects. I’m excited to give <a href=http://prestigeconf.com>Prestige</a> the time it deserves. I’m excited to learn because I want to, not because I need to.</p><p>What does that mean for Lemonly? Not a whole lot. The team I have had the honor of helping build is extremely capable, and the interactive infographics created by the designers at Lemonly are in great hands.</p><p>What does that mean for you? Probably not a lot, <strong>unless you or your company is looking for a contract developer to help bolster your team.</strong> I’ll still be ranting on Twitter, blogging too infrequently, and speaking at conferences.</p><p>I’ve got availability starting in mid-late-February, so <a href=/hire-me/>contact me right away</a>!</p><p>The post <a href=https://joshbroton.com/change-is-scary-the-future-is-bright/>Change is Scary; The Future is Bright</a> appeared first on <a href=https://joshbroton.com>joshbroton.com</a>.</p></article></div></main><footer id=footer class="site-footer bg-primary"><div class=container><div class=text-white><div class=text-center><h2 class="h3 font-weight-normal mb-3">Get in touch</h2></div><div class=cognito><script src=https://www.cognitoforms.com/s/kLQF89okA06rKO0JYMWNOg></script><script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){Cognito.load("forms",{id:"1"});});</script></div></div><div class="float-md-left text-white align-middle">&copy; 2020 Sioux Falls Developer's Group.</div><div class="card bg-transparent border-white text-white float-md-right"><div class=card-body><span class="follow__social__copy mr-2 d-inline-block align-text-bottom" style=line-height:2>Follow SFDevs</span>
