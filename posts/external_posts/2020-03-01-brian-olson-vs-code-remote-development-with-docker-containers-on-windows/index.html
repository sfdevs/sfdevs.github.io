They all have pros and cons, but I’ve been curious about <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview>Remote Development with VS Code</a> for a while so I gave it a try to see if it could make sense to add to the list.</li></ol><p>I’m working on a Windows 10 laptop with <a href=https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>Docker Desktop</a> installed. I found <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers>this article </a>and started running through it.</p><p>First I installed the VS code extension for remote development with containers: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers</a></p><p>No problems on install. It creates a new side bar icon for remote options and some helpful info about the containers you have available. It also shows you the container’s volume mount, which is helpful context.</p><p>I cloned the <a href=https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node>node example repo</a>, and the popup in the article came up no problem, and within seconds I was debugging a node process. Not bad.</p><h2 id=now-with-powershell>Now with PowerShell</h2><p>As usual, I gotta tie it back to PowerShell. My team does a lot of development in PowerShell, and we’re starting to do some PowerShell Core development targeted at Linux. This feels like it could be a good fit.</p><p>I created an empty directory with a .devcontainer directory</p><p>The I mimicked the <code>devcontainer.json</code> file from the node sample repo</p><p>And then created a one line docker file</p><p>When I clicked on the remotes icon a popup offered to reopen the folder inside my dev container. I let it build and it dropped me right into a bash window</p><p>So I added a hello world powershell script through VS Code</p><p>Like I expected the file showed up inside of the container and I could run it with <code>pwsh HelloWorld.ps1</code></p><h2 id=debugging-powershell>Debugging PowerShell</h2><p>Next I wanted to debug my powershell script. At first I was disappointed because it looked like the extension wouldn’t pick that up by default</p><p>But I found <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations>this article</a> on debugging inside of a dev container and it had a helpful link to <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell">this extension</a>.</p><p>I struggled with it for a few minutes before realizing the VS Code was seeing the extension already installed on my local machine, but not in my dev container. I added that to the extension list in my <code>devcontainer.json</code> file like so</p><p>Rebuilt the container, and just like that debugging showed up!</p><p>Lastly, adding this to an existing project was just a matter of copying over the <code>.devcontainers</code> folder (I won’t show any screen shots, because it’s an active project).</p><p>I will note the powershell modules are a sub section of a larger project that includes work in other languages (typescript, python, etc). I had to put the <code>.devcontainer</code> directory in the root of the powershell section of the project.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>There is a little magic happening here, like installing support for VS Code extensions inside of the container. But for the most part it’s pretty standard Docker features like volume mapping, interactive terminals, etc. Just grouped together for convenience.</p><p>Remote development will go into our list of tools for spending time in other languages!</p></div></section><footer id=footer><div class=container><h3>Get in touch</h3><iframe src="https://services.cognitoforms.com/f/kLQF89okA06rKO0JYMWNOg?id=1" style=position:relative;width:1px;min-width:100%;*width:100% frameborder=0 scrolling=yes seamless height=465 width=100%></iframe>
