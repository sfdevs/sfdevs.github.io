In a Hugo project, that’s where the Partial templates come in. Partials are smaller, context-aware components in your list and page templates that can be used economically to keep your templating DRY. Partials, however, have one serious limitation, they’re cached during the build of a given page (or scope). Once a partial has been created, no outside logic can adjust what the partial returns (for the page).</description></item><item><title>Community blogs</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/list/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hosting Hugo on Aws Cloudfront and Route53 Using Ansible</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-04-12-shellrunner-hosting-hugo-on-aws-cloudfront-and-route53-using-ansible/</guid><description>It’s really easy to to set up a website on AWS’s s3 service, but if you want to use a certificate (you do), it’s just a bit more work. With Ansible as my hammer, everything is a nail. Here’s a quick playbook I used to set up my site jxn.is to use cloudfront. This playbook creates the bucket, sets up an s3 website in the bucket, creates a cloudfront distribution with reasonable parameters, enables an existing Certificate Manager certificate on the site, and points DNS records at the cloudfront distribution.</description></item><item><title>Getting Ec2 Instance Availability Zone With Curl or Powershell</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-03-10-shellrunner-getting-ec2-instance-availability-zone-with-curl-or-powershell/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2019 15:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-03-10-shellrunner-getting-ec2-instance-availability-zone-with-curl-or-powershell/</guid><description>I’m a big fan of AWS’s SDK’s and API tools because they’re so comprehensive and easy to use, in general, but I sometimes forget that there’s another good, even simpler API for getting data from some AWS resources… the magical http://169.254.169.254/ http endpoint! This endpoint provides read-only metadata about resources once you have access, and doesn’t require additional authentication. This is very handy, for instance, when a client gives me SSH or RDP access to an EC2 instance and I need to know its size, network info, or in this case what Availability Zone it is in:</description></item><item><title>DSU / AT&amp;T Hackathon</title><link>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-02-27-william-bushee-dsu-at-t-hackathon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2019 03:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sfdevs.com/posts/external_posts/2019-02-27-william-bushee-dsu-at-t-hackathon/</guid><description>We did it.
