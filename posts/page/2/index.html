    <p>eZ Platform boils down to a set of Symfony bundles that give you a nice way of managing content for your users. With these bundles, eZ reserves some routing paths for internal or admin use, paths that you might want for your own app. If you ever run across a path you want to use for your app, and not break an internal eZ feature, there is a simple solution: change the path config.

    <p>Incrementally Moving to Trunk Based Development and CI - Part Two In Part One I laid out my thoughts on Trunk Based Development (TBD) and how it interacts with aspects of DevOps, Automation, Separation of concerns, Clean Architecture and more. Here are some questions you might ask, a hypothetical and resources to reference. What about X? I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of questions floating around in your head. &ldquo;Why should I change my process?

    <p>We pioneered a pattern for exception handling for Zend Framework back as we initially began development on version 2 around seven years ago. The pattern looks like this:
 We would create a marker ExceptionInterface for each package. We would extend SPL exceptions and implement the package marker interface when doing so.  What this gave users was the ability to catch in three ways:
 They could catch the most specific exception type by class name.

    <p>Incrementally Moving to Trunk Based Development and Continuous Integration - Part One Backstory I was eating lunch a few weeks ago and the leader of development at the company I was on contract for, sat down and asked me how things were going. I had just spent a lot of time merging from our Dev branch to our Main branch. We started talking and I was attempting to extoll the virtues of trunk based development and feature flags.

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been running redis in Docker for a number of sites, to perform things such as storing session data, hubot settings, and more.
I recently ran into a problem on one of my systems where it was reporting:
Can't save in background: fork: Out of memory  A quick google search showed this is a common error, so much so that there is an official FAQ about it. The solution is to toggle the /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory to 1.

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on building PHP Docker images for the purposes of testing, as well as to potentially provide images containing the Swoole extension. This is generally straight-forward, as the official PHP images are well-documented.
This week, I decided to see if I could build Alpine-based images, as they can greatly reduce the final image size. And I ran into a problem.
One of the test-beds I use builds RSS and Atom feeds using zend-feed.

    <p>My Developer Manifesto I was inspired by the Rugged Software Development Manifesto and decided to make my own Manifesto or &ldquo;public declaration of policy and aims&rdquo; as defined in the dictionary. I will Work with integrity and honesty Share as quickly as I can when issues arise (estimates are off, things going wrong, other concerns) Share my ideas and opinions with boldness but humility, recognizing that there is much I don&rsquo;t know and others are intelligent Seek feedback, accept it and know that working together improves the system and outcomes Work for the company global business goals and ask why Remember that I&rsquo;m working to solve problems and challenges, not just to write code Productivity does not mean just sitting at a keyboard writing code Work towards breaking down communication barriers between teams Seek to make data driven decisions and rapidly incorporate user feedback Work in small batch sizes and limit Work In Progress (WIP) Since I know I can&rsquo;t think of everything and remember everything I will write tests for what needs to be tests Work in smaller pieces with TDD when it makes sense Document what needs to be document and strive for an up-to-date representation of the system Never stop learning Use the right tools for the job for the right rules Consider maintainability Consider security (Shift left) Push for continuous improvement Share learnings and strive a generative/learning culture Lead by example, follow with humility Strive to put my family and people before my desires and career

    <p>Our own South Dakota Code Camp is coming up soon, and I&rsquo;ll be speaking again. On October 27th, I&rsquo;ll be giving a talk about my approach to debugging software, applications, and operations. The talk, Systematic Debugging is in the day&rsquo;s last session and will be fairly high-level with a few nuggets for experienced programmers sprinkled in as well. Code Camp is at Raven Industries this year, and as always it is free to attend.
